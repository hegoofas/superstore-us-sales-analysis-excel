# 📊 Data Analysis Project - Sales & Profitability Insights (SuperStore US)

This project involves comprehensive data analysis using Microsoft Excel to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations across various business aspects, including sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency, specifically for the SuperStore US dataset.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `SuperStoreUS-2015.xlsx`: Detailed Excel analysis file containing raw data, PivotTables, charts, and KPIs for sales, profitability, regions, and shipping.
* `Insights_Report.pdf`: Final consolidated written recommendations and findings.
* `README.md`: This overview file.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel
* PivotTables
* Charts (Column, Line, etc.)
* Formulas: SUMIFS, AVERAGE, IF, XLOOKUP, AVERAGEIFS, etc.

## 📌 Key Findings

* Office supplies often achieve the highest profit, even though they have the lowest total sales. Other categories achieve high sales but lower profits, often due to discounts and shipping costs.
* Some months achieve high sales and profits, such as April, June, and February, while others (e.g., January and March) show lower sales and very little profit, likely due to large discounts or seasonal closure.
* The East region has the highest sales, whereas the South region shows a significant decline in profitability and sales compared to other regions, indicating a need for marketing intervention.

## ✅ Recommendations

1.  Prioritize delivery, especially to remote areas.
2.  Review and optimize discount policies, overall pricing, and shipping costs.
3.  Focus marketing and sales efforts more on specific high-potential cities rather than just broad geographic regions (e.g., California).
4.  While Regular Air is the most common shipping method, it may be costly; explore and recommend alternative, more cost-effective methods to customers.
5.  Develop special features and offers tailored for the most demanding and loyal regular customers.
